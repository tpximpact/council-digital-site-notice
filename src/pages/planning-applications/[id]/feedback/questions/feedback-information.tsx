            You may be able to highlight on-the-ground details we don’t know
            about – for example, that a mature tree was left out of a
            developer's plans.

          <p className="govuk-body">
            Your understanding of an area’s needs can help planners decide on
            things like amount of open space, cycling facilities, or what

          <p className="govuk-body">
            It's useful know which priorities are most important to residents,
            so we can push developers to be more ambitious with their targets.
            Telling us what your priorities are can help planners make that
            decision.
